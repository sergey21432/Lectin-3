# Instruction for work with the Markdown

## Headings

Use the "#" to add heading. You can add six levels of headings.

## Line breaks

To add line break use the tag **""br" in <>**.
For example, 
like <br> that

Paragraphs
---------

Add a empty string to create a paragraph. For example,
"Bye,

See you tomorrow".

## Text highlighting

To highlight text in italics, use the selection of "*" or "_". For example, *like that* or _like that_.

To make a text bold, use the selection of "**" or "__". For example, **like that** or __like that__.

Use alternative methods to combine of text highlighting. For example, _italics text selection and **text bold**_.

## Lists

Use "*" (also "+" or "-") before a text to add unnumbered list. For example:
* Element 1
* Element 2
+ Element 3

Use a item numbering to add a numbered list (MD sort by numbering). For example:
1. First item
1. Second item
1. Third item

To create hierarchy for lists, use "TAB" in start.

Use "TAB" to create item out of list, but between list's item.

## Work with images

To add images, use the next construction: ![*DESCRIPTION*](***link for image***)

For example:
 ![Hi, it's Boston](Boston.png)

## Links

To add links use the next construction: `[TEXT]](link "Text by the link")`. For example, [Text](link "Text by the link").

For easy reading, you can add links to end. Use the next construction:
`[item][key]`
empty string
`[key]: link "text by the link"`

For example,
[that links to lection][1].

[1]: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n5HgaTCVqU&feature=emb_imp_woyt>

If you want to see the link use the "<" and ">" to highlight link. For example, <sergey21432@yandex.ru>.

## Work with tables

## Quotes

Use the ">" to add blockquotes. 

If you want add paragraph in blockquotes, add ">" in start of empty string.

If you want create hierarchy of quotes use additional ">". For example,
> First quote
>
>>Second quote
