# Instruction for work with the Markdown

## Headings

Use the "#" to add heading. You can add six levels of headings.

## Text highlighting

To highlight text in italics, use the selection of "*" or "_". For example, *like that* or _like that_.

To make a text bold, use the selection of "**" or "__". For example, **like that** or __like that__.

Use alternative methods to combine of text highlighting. For example, _italics text selection and **text bold**_.

## Lists

Use "*" or "+" before a text to add unnumbered list. For example:
* Element 1
* Element 2
+ Element 3

Use item numbering to add numbered list. For example:
1. First item
1. Second item
1. Third item

## Work with images

To add images, use the next construction: ![*DESCRIPTION*](***link for image***)

For example:
 ![Hi, it's Boston](Boston.png)

## Links

To add links use the next construction: [TEXT]]+(link "Text by the link").
[Text](link "Text by the link").

For easy reading, you can add links to end: use the next construction - [item]+[key].
empty paragraph
[key]: link "text by the link"

 For example,
[that links to lection][1].

[1]: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n5HgaTCVqU&feature=emb_imp_woyt>

If you want to see the link use the "<" and ">" to highlight link. For example, <sergey21432@yandex.ru>.
